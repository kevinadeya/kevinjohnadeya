      <h3>History</h3>
    
      <p>Crossing Borders (CB) started its activities for youth
          and educators in the Middle East in October 1999. It
          developed from the “Learning to Live Together in the
          Middle East” Project. This project started in 1994 as a
          summer seminar that was held in Helsingør, between
          1994 and 1998, for Arab and Israeli educators,
          teachers and journalists from Egypt, Israel, Jordan</p>
